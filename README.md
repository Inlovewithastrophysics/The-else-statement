# The-else-statement
An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the condition is false.
The code in the file (The else statement) will test the condition:
- If it evaluates to true, then the code inside the if statement will be executed.
- If it evaluates to false, then the code inside the else statement will be executed.
-
When only one statement is used inside the if/else, then the curly braces can be omitted.
